# Project2
Project 2 working area

After cleaning the dataset for this part, there is a total of 444700 items to work with. It was used python, pandas and matplotlib. The data analysis is focus on some statistics and relationships among the considered variables. Numbers of traffic accidents and their respective percentages were calculated given certain road conditions and the time of day or night they occurred. Bar and bubble charts were presented trying to visualize the relationship among the variables considered. It was used the “Pands.DataFrame.groupby” in order to group data and compute some operations on these groups. It was also used the “value_counts().unique” to determine some characteristics related to variables studied. They were also calculated the frequency distribution (histogram) of the speed limit for all traffic crashes and also for specific conditions of the roads.

All this analysis should be the basis for developing public programs that contribute to a safer way of traveling.

Part 1 considers the analysis of the number of traffic crashes vs the road conditions and speed limits.

Part 2, considers the analysis of the number of traffic crashes vs the lighting conditions, crash type and road defects.

Here are some interesting findings about traffic crashes Let us begin saying that 47.4% of the traffic crashes occur at day light, in dry roads and no defect roads.

In what road conditions, traffic accidents mainly occurs? Dry roads 75% and in wet roads 14%.

80% of the accidents occur when the speed limit is between 30 and 40 mph speed limit

Besides, when the road is wet there was 50,000 traffic crashes, and when the road es dry occurred 275,000 traffic crashes.

Another interesting aspect is that 86.5% of the traffic crashes occur in daylights or lighted road.

The most common type of traffic crashes occur by rear end of the cars and with parked motor vehicles.

All of these are extremely interesting aspects that must be taken into account to make an objective analysis of traffic accidents.
